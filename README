This is a package to make the transition to bufr reports from alphanumeric text easiest as possible. 

A lot of software is coded asuming that the primary source of meteorological reports is in alphanumeric format. 
Decode libraries are expecting this. But time is changing, meteorological services are migrating to bufr and 
other binary formats. Most decode software have to be changed.

This is a software to get meteorological reports in old alphanumeric format from bufr files. At the moment includes the following 
reports:

  - FM 12-XIV SYNOP
  - FM 13-XIV SHIP
  - FM 14-XIV SYNOP MOBIL
  - FM 18-XII BUOY

The software is based in bufrdc library from ECMWF.  *It have to be installed*. In that package there is a synop2bufr 
application doing just the reverse task. You can grab this library from 

http://old.ecmwf.int/products/data/software/bufr.html

Follow the instructions to build and install bufrdc library. Then, you can use this package.

Note that the results from this library is not intended to match at %100 level to original alphanumeric reports. 
It cannot. Some variables in alphanumeric code rules can be coded in several ways, and there is not a regional 
even national decision about them. As example, the 'hshs' item (table code 1617) for synop FM-12 can be coded 
using 00-80 range or 90-99 one. A numeric value for heigh of base clouds can be coded in two ways. And there some 
few more examples.

BUILD

If you uses git repository, first time you clone the code you need to set the autotools files. To achieve this just 

   make -f Makefile.cvs

If you get the package from a tarball then, from package directory to configure

  ./configure
  
and to build the package

  make
